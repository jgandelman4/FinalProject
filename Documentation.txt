How to register as a group
In order to register as a new group, go to "create a new wefree group". Provide your personal gcal address, as well a group password which you decide to share with
your group members. If the information is succesfully submitted to MySQL, you will see a pop-up page congratulating you on the success of registering a new
group and informing you about sharing your group password. Please note that since each gcal can only be affiliated with one group, you may not be able to register 
new groups if you have already registered with other groups. There is also a link to a visual demonstration on how to share your calendar with WeFree.

How to register as an individual
Similar to registering as a group, you need to provide a gcal address and a group password to join the group in WeFree. Remember your group password must match the one
that is already recorded in our database, as determined by the first person who created the group. Additionally, you gcal must share your "freebusy" information
with WeFree. All you need to do is to change the privacy setting in gCal, there is a link to a visual demonstration on how to do that at the bottom of the
register page.

How to Log in
Just provide your gcal address and your group password. If both are correct, you will be directed to the mainpage, where you can check everyone's free time!

How to search time
In the "WeFree Search" option, you can change date, month and year of the periods you want to search (in EST). The date will be filled in based on the current
date by default. The search range starts from 00:00:00 of start search day, and ends on 24:00:00 of end search date. If there are any mutual free times that all
group members share, the results will be listed at the bottom. Conversely, if there is no free time, you will not see any results. If you enter a end time that
precedes the start time, the website also will not output results.
